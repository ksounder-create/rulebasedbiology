<h1>Rule-Based Biology</h1>

<div class="summary-box">
<strong>Summary</strong><br>
Rule-Based Biology is a complete reconstruction of biological understanding grounded in explicit governing rules. It replaces descriptive, correlation-based biology with a fully rational, internally consistent system in which biological behavior is constrained, derivable, and precisely interconnected.
</div>

<h2>A Complete Replacement</h2>

<p>
Rule-Based Biology is not a refinement, extension, or reinterpretation of existing biology. It is a complete replacement.
</p>

<p>
The foundations of current biology and Rule-Based Biology are entirely different. They share no common explanatory basis. As a result, mechanisms, interpretations, and conclusions differ at every level of organization.
</p>

<p>
Where descriptive biology infers mechanisms from observation, Rule-Based Biology derives mechanisms from necessity.
</p>

<h2>A Fully Rational System</h2>

<p>
In Rule-Based Biology, all biological behavior is governed by explicit rules. These rules impose strict constraints on molecular interactions, cellular processes, and system-level behavior.
</p>

<p>
There are no exceptions. Apparent exceptions arise only when observations are interpreted outside the governing framework.
</p>

<p>
Because the rules operate in parallel and never contradict one another, biological processes are fully interconnected. Cellular pathways are not independent modules but constrained components of a single coherent system.
</p>

<h2>Reconstruction Across Biology</h2>

<p>
The application of governing rules across large-scale biomedical literature reconstructs biological processes at every level, including metabolism, signaling, gene regulation, cellular organization, and disease mechanisms.
</p>

<p>
Processes traditionally treated as separate — involving enzymes, inhibitors, activators, intermediates, and regulatory factors — resolve into structured relationships governed by the same constraints.
</p>

<p>
This reconstruction is supported by extensive experimental evidence. Thousands of independent observations converge when interpreted under the governing rules, with no contradictions.
</p>

<h2>Closure and Extensibility</h2>

<p>
The current reconstruction covers a vast range of biological processes documented in the literature. What remains unexplored is not outside the framework.
</p>

<p>
Any biological phenomenon not yet reconstructed can be analyzed using the same governing rules. Extension does not require new principles, only application.
</p>

<p>
As a result, Rule-Based Biology is complete in structure and extensible in scope.
</p>

<h2>From Biology to System</h2>

<p>
With governing rules made explicit, biology ceases to be a collection of observations and becomes a rational system.
</p>

<p>
Explanation becomes derivation. Prediction replaces interpretation. Complexity becomes structured.
</p>

<p>
This is not a methodological proposal.
</p>

<p>
It is a completed reconstruction.
</p>

<h2>Learning the Method</h2>

<p>
Rule-Based Biology is not a collection of claims.  
It is a method for identifying and applying governing rules.
</p>

<p>
The method cannot be conveyed through examples alone.  
It must be learned systematically.
</p>

<p>
A structured course is now available for those who wish to study the method directly.
