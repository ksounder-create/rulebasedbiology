    <h1>Rule-Based Biology</h1>
    <p><em>A reconstructed framework for understanding life</em></p>

    <p>
        Rule-based biology represents a fundamental reconstruction of how biological systems are understood.
        It is not an extension of existing theory, nor a reinterpretation of established models.
        It is a framework derived from the identification and application of governing rules that constrain biological behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
        When these rules are applied consistently, it becomes evident that much of contemporary biology —
        particularly molecular biology and biochemistry — cannot support a coherent or mechanistic account of life.
        This limitation does not arise from insufficient data, but from the absence of a rule-based structure capable
        of constraining interpretation.
    </p>

    <div class="summary-box">
        <strong>Summary</strong><br>
        Rule-based biology replaces descriptive interpretation with structural explanation.  
        It does not modify existing biology — it reconstructs it.
    </div>

    <h2>Why Existing Biology Cannot Be Corrected</h2>

    <p>
        It is not possible to correct present biological theory through incremental refinement.
        The problem is not localized error, but foundational inadequacy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Biology is built upon proteins, small molecules, ions, and their interactions.
        These elements drive transcription, replication, translation, metabolism, regulation,
        and cellular organization. Yet they are not defined in a way that allows their behavior
        to be derived from first principles.
    </p>

    <p>
        Protein function, in particular, is inferred from experimental context rather than
        derived from governing constraints. As a result, higher-order explanations are constructed
        on foundations that are themselves undefined.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the behavior of a single protein is not mechanistically specified, then:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>transcription cannot be rigorously explained</li>
        <li>replication cannot be formally derived</li>
        <li>regulation cannot be resolved</li>
        <li>cellular behavior cannot be predicted</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Any theoretical structure built upon such elements is necessarily unstable.
    </p>

    <h2>The Structural Failure of Classical Biology</h2>

    <p>
        The core limitation of classical biology is not error, but unconstrained interpretation.
        In the absence of governing rules, observations were interpreted locally, contradictions
        were tolerated, and partial explanations were generalized.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because no formal constraints existed:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>incompatible explanations could coexist</li>
        <li>missing mechanisms could be ignored</li>
        <li>exceptions were absorbed rather than resolved</li>
        <li>coherence was never enforced</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The failure, therefore, was not empirical.  
        It was structural.
    </p>

    <h2>What Rule-Based Analysis Establishes</h2>

    <p>
        When governing rules are applied, biological systems become internally coherent.
        The rules impose necessary constraints that eliminate incompatible interpretations
        and relate molecular behavior to system-level outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Under this framework:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>biological components cannot be understood in isolation</li>
        <li>function arises from constrained interactions</li>
        <li>behavior follows necessity, not probability</li>
        <li>system-level properties become derivable</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The rules do not reinterpret biological entities.  
        They define them.
    </p>

    <h2>A Different Biology</h2>

    <p>
        Rule-based biology is not an improved version of current biology.
        It is a different biology.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this framework:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>biological processes are intrinsically connected</li>
        <li>regulation follows definable constraints</li>
        <li>molecular behavior is mechanistic</li>
        <li>system-level behavior is explainable</li>
        <li>contradictions cannot persist</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Proteins, pathways, diseases, and therapeutic effects are no longer treated as
        isolated observations, but as expressions of a single, rule-governed structure.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
        Because existing biology lacks a rule-based foundation, it cannot be corrected
        through incremental refinement. Its limitations are inherent to its interpretive framework.
    </p>

    <p>
        Rule-based biology replaces that framework with one in which explanation precedes interpretation,
        coherence replaces accumulation, and understanding replaces description.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is not a reinterpretation of biology.  
        It is the structure biology was missing.
    </p>
