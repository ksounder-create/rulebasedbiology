        <h1>Rule-Based Biology™</h1>
        <p><strong>Solving real problems by applying the rules that govern systems. [cite: 2]</strong></p>

        <h2>Why This Matters Today</h2>
        <p>Science produces data—not necessarily understanding. [cite: 8] Descriptions do not explain causality or constraints. [cite: 9] Without governing rules, innovation stagnates. [cite: 10]</p>
        
        <p>Rule-Based Biology™ changes that by focusing on <strong>governing rules</strong> rather than data accumulation. [cite: 5, 6]</p>

                <p>A new approach focused on understanding life through validated rules rather than memorization. [cite: 17, 18]</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Consultancy</h3>
                <p>Application-oriented problem solving for complex challenges where existing understanding falls short. [cite: 22, 23]</p>

        <h2>Key Differences</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Conventional Science:</strong> Focuses on data, models, and correlations. [cite: 42]</li>
            <li><strong>Rule-Based Thinking:</strong> Focuses on constraints, necessity, and fundamental feasibility. [cite: 43]</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>When the rules are understood and available, solutions emerge naturally. [cite: 44]</blockquote>
