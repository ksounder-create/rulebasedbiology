    <h3>What This Site Is</h3>
    <p>
      Rule-Based Biology is a reconstruction of biological science based on the discovery
      of governing rules that determine how biological systems operate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not a theory, not a reinterpretation, and not an extension of existing biology.
      It is a framework built from identifying constraints that must hold across all biological systems.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>Why This Site Exists</h3>
    <p>
      Modern biology has produced enormous volumes of data, yet has failed to converge
      on a coherent understanding of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not due to lack of effort or experimentation, but due to the absence
      of governing rules capable of organizing that data into a consistent framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site exists to present what emerges once those rules are identified.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>The Central Idea</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Rules give data meaning.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Without rules, observations remain isolated.
      With rules, biology becomes predictable, coherent, and mechanistic.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site documents that transition.
    </p>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>How to Use This Site</h3>
    <p>
      The material is organized as a logical progression:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Why Biology Failed</strong> — explains the structural problem</li>
      <li><strong>Why Rules Matter</strong> — explains why rules are necessary</li>
      <li><strong>Rule-Based Biology</strong> — presents the new framework</li>
      <li><strong>Applications</strong> — shows what becomes possible</li>
      <li><strong>AI & the Future</strong> — explains broader implications</li>
      <li><strong>Students & Careers</strong> — explains what this means for learners</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The pages are designed to be read in order, though each can stand on its own.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>What This Is Not</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Not a speculative theory</li>
      <li>Not a philosophical argument</li>
      <li>Not an alternative interpretation of biology</li>
      <li>Not dependent on belief or consensus</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This work is grounded in consistency, constraint, and logical necessity.
    </p>

  <section class="block callout">
    <p>
      Biology becomes intelligible when rules are known.<br>
      This site documents that realization.
