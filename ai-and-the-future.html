<h1>Natural Intelligence and Next Generation AI</h1>

<!-- ===== CUSP SECTION ===== -->

<div class="callout">
    <strong>1. Rules and Data Reveal Natural Intelligence</strong><br>
    Nature operates through rules.  
    Experimental data records the outcomes of those rules in action.  
    When viewed together, they reveal natural intelligence — the lawful structure that governs living systems.
</div>

<div class="callout">
    <strong>2. All Products of Nature Express Its Potential</strong><br>
    Every form, function, process, and living system is a manifestation of what nature makes possible.  
    Life, disease, adaptation, and complexity are not accidents, but expressions of underlying potential shaped by rules.
</div>

<div class="callout">
    <strong>3. Rules, Data, and AI Enable Rapid Understanding</strong><br>
    When rules and experimental data are brought together through AI, understanding accelerates.  
    Insight no longer depends solely on new experimentation, but on revealing structure within what is already known.
</div>

<!-- ===== MAIN CONTENT ===== -->

<h2>Natural Intelligence: The Missing Foundation</h2>

<p>
Natural intelligence is not human intelligence.  
It is the intelligence inherent in nature itself — the lawful organization that governs biological systems.
</p>

<p>
It expresses itself through:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Governing rules</li>
    <li>Structural constraints</li>
    <li>Directional biological processes</li>
    <li>Invariant relationships</li>
</ul>

<p>
These rules exist independently of observation.  
They define what is biologically possible.
</p>

<p>
Without recognizing this intelligence, biology remains descriptive rather than explanatory.
</p>

---

<h2>Data: The Record of Nature’s Output</h2>

<p>
Modern biology has accumulated an enormous body of data:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Molecular interactions</li>
    <li>Cellular responses</li>
    <li>Pathways and regulatory networks</li>
    <li>Drug effects and failures</li>
</ul>

<p>
These represent products and processes — not understanding.
</p>

<p>
Data alone cannot reveal governing principles.  
But when interpreted through rules, it becomes meaningful.
</p>

<h2>Next Generation AI: The Integrating Force</h2>

<p>
Artificial Intelligence becomes transformative only when placed within this structure.
</p>

<p>
When AI operates using:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Rules derived from natural intelligence</li>
    <li>Experimental data from biology</li>
</ul>

<p>
it can:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Form lawful connections across datasets</li>
    <li>Identify missing or incomplete rules</li>
    <li>Explore biological possibilities without trial-and-error</li>
    <li>Predict outcomes rather than merely fit models</li>
</ul>

<p>
AI moves from correlation to comprehension.
</p>

<h2>A New Scientific Architecture</h2>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Component</th>
        <th>Role</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Natural Intelligence</td>
        <td>Provides governing rules</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Data</td>
        <td>Records biological outcomes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Artificial Intelligence</td>
        <td>Integrates, explores, and predicts</td>
    </tr>
</table>

---

<h2>What This Enables</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Predictive rather than descriptive biology</li>
    <li>Rapid generation of usable knowledge</li>
    <li>Reduction of redundant experimentation</li>
    <li>Faster development of technology</li>
    <li>Rule-based scientific progress</li>
</ul>

<p>
Science shifts from accumulation to understanding.
</p>

---

<h2>The Direction Forward</h2>

<p>
The future of science is not defined by more data.  
Nor by larger AI models.
</p>

<p>
It is defined by alignment:
</p>

<p>
<strong>Natural Intelligence → Rules</strong><br>
<strong>Data → Evidence</strong><br>
<strong>Artificial Intelligence → Exploration</strong>
</p>

<p>
This is the foundation of <strong>Next Generation AI</strong> —  
and the beginning of a lawful, predictive science.
