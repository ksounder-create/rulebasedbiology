<h1>AI and the Future</h1>

<p>
Artificial intelligence is often described as a transformative technology.
Yet despite its apparent power, AI today remains fundamentally limited in what it can understand.
</p>

<p>
This limitation does not arise from insufficient data or computational power.
It arises from the absence of rules.
</p>

<div class="summary-box">
<strong>Summary</strong><br>
AI without rules can recognize patterns.  
AI with rules can understand systems.
</div>

<h2>The Limits of Data-Driven Intelligence</h2>

<p>
Modern AI systems operate by identifying statistical relationships within large datasets.
They excel at recognizing patterns, generating text, and optimizing predictions.
</p>

<p>
However, pattern recognition is not understanding.
</p>

<p>
Without rules, AI cannot:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>distinguish causation from correlation</li>
    <li>recognize impossibility</li>
    <li>identify contradictions</li>
    <li>reason about mechanisms</li>
</ul>

<p>
As a result, AI systems reproduce existing interpretations rather than generate new understanding.
</p>

<h2>Why Biology Exposes AI’s Limits</h2>

<p>
Biology is an ideal test case for intelligence.
It is complex, structured, and governed by constraints.
</p>

<p>
Yet current biological knowledge is itself fragmented and inconsistent.
When AI is trained on this data, it inherits those limitations.
</p>

<p>
Without an underlying rule-based framework, AI can only reorganize uncertainty.
It cannot resolve it.
</p>

<h2>The Role of Rules in Intelligence</h2>

<p>
Rules define what is possible and what is not.
They constrain interpretation and enforce consistency.
</p>

<p>
In physics and engineering, rules enable prediction.
In biology, their absence has prevented it.
</p>

<p>
When biological rules are made explicit, AI gains something fundamentally new:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>logical structure</li>
    <li>mechanistic grounding</li>
    <li>constraints on inference</li>
    <li>the ability to reject false explanations</li>
</ul>

<h2>From Pattern Matching to Understanding</h2>

<p>
AI without rules operates statistically.
AI with rules operates logically.
</p>

<p>
This distinction is critical.
Without rules, AI systems may appear intelligent while remaining fundamentally blind
to mechanism, causality, and meaning.
</p>

<p>
With rules, AI becomes capable of reasoning about systems rather than merely describing them.
</p>

<h2>Implications for the Future</h2>

<p>
The future of AI does not depend on larger models or more data alone.
It depends on structure.
</p>

<p>
When rule-based frameworks are integrated:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>AI becomes interpretable</li>
    <li>predictions become explainable</li>
    <li>errors become diagnosable</li>
    <li>applications become reliable</li>
</ul>

<p>
This applies not only to biology, but to any domain governed by underlying constraints.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
AI does not fail because it lacks intelligence.
It fails because it lacks rules.
</p>

<p>
Rule-based biology provides a foundation on which meaningful artificial intelligence can be built —
one grounded in understanding rather than approximation.
</p>

<p>
The future of AI is not larger models.
It is structured knowledge.
