<h1>The Foundations of Biology</h1>

<div class="summary-box">
<strong>Summary</strong><br>
A rule-based framework for understanding life, disease, and biological systems.
</div>

<p>
Biology has generated vast amounts of data, yet its foundational structure has remained unclear. Despite decades of research, biological systems are still largely interpreted through description, correlation, and statistical association rather than governing principles.
</p>

<p>
This work presents a rule-based framework for understanding life, disease, and biological systems. It identifies the underlying constraints that govern biological behavior and shows how these rules bring coherence, predictability, and structure to processes that previously appeared complex or ambiguous.
</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>
Modern biology is rich in data but poor in explanation.
</p>

<p>
Despite decades of molecular research, biological systems remain difficult to interpret, unpredictable in behavior, and resistant to unifying theory.
</p>

<p>
This is not due to lack of effort or technology. It reflects a deeper conceptual gap.
</p>

<h2>What Is Missing</h2>

<p>
All mature sciences operate under governing rules.
</p>

<p>
Physics, chemistry, and engineering progress because their systems are constrained by laws that define what can and cannot occur.
</p>

<p>
Biology developed without such a framework.
</p>

<p>
As a result, it relies heavily on description, correlation, and post-hoc explanation.
</p>

<h2>The Role of Rules</h2>

<p>
Rules are not models or assumptions.
</p>

<p>
They are constraints that make systems intelligible.
</p>

<p>
When rules are known:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>mechanisms become derivable</li>
    <li>contradictions collapse</li>
    <li>predictions become possible</li>
</ul>

<p>
Rule-Based Biology begins with the identification of these governing principles.
</p>

<h2>A New Direction for Biology</h2>

<p>
Rule-Based Biology does not add another layer of theory.
</p>

<p>
It restructures biology around the rules that govern energy, structure, and function.
</p>

<p>
This shift enables:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>coherent understanding of biological processes</li>
    <li>mechanistic interpretation of disease</li>
    <li>predictive rather than descriptive science</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why This Matters Now</h2>

<p>
Biology now underpins medicine, agriculture, biotechnology, and artificial intelligence.
</p>

<p>
Without a rule-based foundation, progress in these fields remains slow, expensive, and uncertain.
</p>

<p>
With rules, complexity becomes manageable.
</p>

<h2>What Comes Next</h2>

<p>
This site presents:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>why current biology failed</li>
    <li>why rules are necessary</li>
    <li>how rule-based biology works</li>
    <li>what it enables for science and society</li>
</ul>

<p>
The transition from description to understanding has already begun.
</p>

<p>
What follows is the structure behind it.
