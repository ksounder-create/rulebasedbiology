<h1>Why Rules Matter</h1>

<p>
Scientific understanding advances only when observations are constrained by rules.
Without rules, data accumulates but meaning does not.
</p>

<p>
Rules are not models, and they are not hypotheses. They are constraints that determine
what is possible, what is impossible, and what must follow from a given set of conditions.
In every mature science, rules precede explanation.
</p>

<div class="summary-box">
<strong>Summary</strong><br>
Rules transform description into understanding.  
Without rules, knowledge remains fragmented and non-predictive.
</div>

<h2>What Rules Do</h2>

<p>
Rules impose structure on complexity. They define relationships that must hold
regardless of context, scale, or interpretation.
</p>

<p>
When rules exist:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>causality can be established</li>
    <li>contradictions are eliminated</li>
    <li>mechanisms can be derived</li>
    <li>predictions become possible</li>
</ul>

<p>
In their absence, explanation collapses into description.
</p>

<h2>Why Biology Lacked Rules</h2>

<p>
Biology developed as an observational science. Its early success came from cataloguing
phenomena rather than explaining them.
</p>

<p>
As molecular data accumulated, interpretation expanded faster than understanding.
Without a framework of constraints, explanations became contextual, provisional,
and often incompatible with one another.
</p>

<p>
This was not a failure of experimentation, but of structure.
</p>

<h2>The Difference Between Data and Understanding</h2>

<p>
Data alone cannot generate understanding. Data must be interpreted through rules
that define how components relate and what outcomes are permissible.
</p>

<p>
Without rules:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>correlation substitutes for causation</li>
    <li>exceptions accumulate without resolution</li>
    <li>mechanisms remain inferred, not derived</li>
    <li>models proliferate without convergence</li>
</ul>

<p>
Rules provide the constraints that make understanding possible.
</p>

<h2>What Changes When Rules Are Applied</h2>

<p>
When rules are identified and applied consistently, biological systems acquire structure.
Processes that appeared independent become connected. Apparent contradictions resolve.
Complexity becomes organized rather than overwhelming.
</p>

<p>
Most importantly, explanation becomes possible without reliance on empirical trial alone.
</p>

<h2>Rules as a Foundation, Not an Addition</h2>

<p>
Rules do not refine existing biology. They redefine it.
</p>

<p>
They do not add another layer of interpretation. They replace interpretation with structure.
They do not compete with data. They make data intelligible.
</p>

<p>
This is why rule-based biology is not an extension of current biology,
but a different way of understanding biological systems altogether.
</p>

<h2>What Follows</h2>

<p>
If biology can be governed by rules, then it can be understood with the same rigor
as other foundational sciences.
</p>

<p>
The next step is to examine what biology looks like when those rules are applied.
That is the subject of <em>Rule-Based Biology</em>.
