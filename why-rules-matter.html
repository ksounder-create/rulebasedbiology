    <h2>Why Rules Matter</h2>
    <p class="hero-text">
      Scientific understanding begins only when rules are identified.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>What Are Rules?</h3>
    <p>
      Rules are not models. They are not hypotheses.
      They are fundamental constraints that define what can and cannot occur within biological systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their validity arises from consistent patterns observed across vast biochemical and molecular datasets.
      They describe what biological components must do — not what they might do.
    </p>
    <p>
      In every mature science, rules precede explanation.
      Without rules, data accumulates but understanding does not.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>Why Biology Lacks Rules</h3>
    <p>
      The absence of explicit rules in modern biology is not accidental.
      It arose from the way the field developed.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Focus on isolated parts rather than integrated systems</li>
      <li>Emphasis on correlation over mechanism</li>
      <li>Dependence on statistical interpretation</li>
      <li>Artificial separation of chemistry, biology, and physics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This produced a self-reinforcing cycle in which experiments generated data,
      data produced weak principles, and those principles guided further experiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result was increasing detail without convergence.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>What Rules Do</h3>
    <p>
      Rules impose structure on complexity.
      They define relationships that hold regardless of context or scale.
    </p>

    <h4>Rules Define Proteins With Respect To:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Post-translational modification</li>
      <li>Conformational change</li>
      <li>Stability and degradation</li>
      <li>Activation and inhibition</li>
      <li>Localization and trafficking</li>
      <li>Isoform-specific behavior</li>
      <li>Transcriptional and translational control</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Rules Define Small Molecules With Respect To:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Synthesis and transformation</li>
      <li>Energy storage and transfer</li>
      <li>Redox balance</li>
      <li>Signaling behavior</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Rules Define Cellular Behavior:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Cell-cycle progression</li>
      <li>Quiescence and senescence</li>
      <li>Growth and differentiation</li>
      <li>Stress responses</li>
      <li>Organelle dynamics</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>How Good Are the Rules?</h3>
    <p>
      The rules identified in this framework:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Are independently verifiable</li>
      <li>Apply across species</li>
      <li>Do not contradict one another</li>
      <li>Allow no exceptions</li>
      <li>Reveal mechanisms rather than correlations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Nature does not operate by inconsistent principles.
      Apparent contradictions arise only when rules are missing.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>What the Rules Reveal</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Biological behavior becomes interpretable</li>
      <li>Contradictions dissolve</li>
      <li>Mechanisms replace description</li>
      <li>Prediction becomes possible</li>
      <li>Complexity becomes organized</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Without rules, biology remains observational.
      With rules, it becomes explanatory.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>Why This Matters Now</h3>
    <p>
      Modern biology faces growing limitations: increasing disease complexity,
      diminishing returns in drug discovery, and dependence on data without theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are not isolated problems.
      They arise from operating without governing principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rule-based biology replaces trial-and-error with structured reasoning,
      restoring coherence to biological science.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>An Example: Molecular Transport</h3>
    <p>
      Molecular transport is traditionally treated as an extremely complex process
      involving countless transporters and exceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rule-based approach replaces this fragmentation with a single governing principle
      that defines when molecules enter, remain in, or exit cells.
    </p>
    <p>
      What once required thousands of observations becomes predictable through structure.
    </p>
